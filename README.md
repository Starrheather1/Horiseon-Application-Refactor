# <Challenge-Week-1>

## Description

The ultimate goal as a front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I have reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. I have also added alt attributes after all of the img elements and added a descriptive title.
